                Downey was born in Manhattan on 4th April 1965, New York, the younger
                of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., is an actor and
                filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann, was an actress who appeared in
                Downey Sr.'s films. Robert's original family name was Elias which was
                changed by his father to enlist in the Army. As a child, Downey was
                "surrounded by drugs." His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to
                use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father later said he
                regretted.Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond
                between him and his father:During his childhood, Downey had minor
                roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of
                five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and
                then at seven appeared in the surrealist Greaser's Palace (1972) In
                May 1992, he married actress Deborah Falconer. Two years later, the
                couple had a son, Indio, naming friend and actor, Anthony Michael
                Hall, as the boy's godfather.

                Downey's 'Chaplin' (1992) is one of his biggest achievements until
                now. Richard Attenborough, the director of the movie, got him trained
                in many aspects that were necessary for a true portrayal of Chaplin,
                like, learning how to play violin, etc. Joining the cast of American
                television mini-series 'Ally McBeal', after serving his time in the
                prison, in 2000, was a great professional move from Downey's side. He
                won many accolades for his role in the series. Downey's
                characterization of 'Tony Stark' in 'Iron Man (2008)', 'Iron Man 2
                (2010)' and 'Iron Man 3 (2013), has made him into a huge blockbuster
                phenomena. His quirky and nonchalant personality in real life reflects
                in 'Tony Stark' which has made it so successful.

                condition of posting $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge
                ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (spawned
                from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release.
